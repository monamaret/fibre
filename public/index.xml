      <description>Pattern drafting can be done by software but I prefer to do it by hand. I work with computers so the last thing I really want to do when I am looking to unwind is more computer; as it turns out, I really enjoy the process of drafting patterns with pencil and paper. It helps me think through the construction steps and what I really want in a design.
The simplest description of pattern drafting is that it is when a pattern is created from bodily measurements, mapping points on a paper, and drawing lines between the points.</description>
