I work with computers so the last thing I really want to do when I am looking to unwind is more computer; as it turns out, I really enjoy the process of drafting patterns with pencil and paper. It helps me think through the construction steps and what I really want in a design.</p><p>The simplest description of pattern drafting is that it is when a pattern is created from bodily measurements, mapping points on a paper, and drawing lines between the points. There&rsquo;s more to it than that of course but it&rsquo;s not something that explicitly requires software to accomplish. Software makes it easier to scale up patterns for many different sizes but if you&rsquo;re just making them for yourself there isn&rsquo;t really a need for it.</p><p>What you do need are a few tools. None of them are expensive but without them you&rsquo;ll struggle more than necessary.</p><h2 id=styling-ruler>Styling ruler</h2><p>Probably the most important tool you&rsquo;ll need is a styling ruler, which is a clear plastic ruler with a 1/8" grid printed through the body. They come in plain flat 18" versions and thicker versions with a curve built into one end; I prefer the plain thin flat ones.</p><p>The styling ruler is used to complete lines between points and add seam allowances. It needs to be clear because adding a seam allowance with a metal or other ruler that you can&rsquo;t see through is impossible. I like the thinner ones because it&rsquo;s easier to draw weird curves with a thinner ruler even if it is straight than with the thicker acrylic of the curved ones, but it&rsquo;s a personal preference.</p><h2 id=measuring-tape>Measuring tape</h2><p>The measuring tape is for measuring the body, just like for sewing. If you sew you probably already have a few laying around. It&rsquo;s important to periodically check that the measuring tape actually has the correct measurements (just hold it up to your styling ruler periodically) because they stretch out over time. They&rsquo;re also not terribly accurate even when new which usually isn&rsquo;t a huge problem with clothing unless you&rsquo;re making a lot of very tight things in wovens, but if you find that your patterns seems to be consistently off an inch or two despite re-measuring the body it&rsquo;s worth just confirming the tape hasn&rsquo;t stretched.</p><h2 id=mechanical-pencil>Mechanical pencil</h2><p>They don&rsquo;t have to be fancy (although I have a few fancy ones and I love them dearly) but it&rsquo;s better to use a mechanical pencil than a wooden one because you&rsquo;ll go through a lot of lead and you want to maintain a consistent line width on the lines you draw. A non-disposable mechanical pencil will allow you to use a harder and darker lead and they usually have nicer erasers (which are also replaceable); I like Pentel Graphigear 0.5 MM the best but I have several disposable ones in my pencil caddy and they work just fine.</p><h2 id=eraser>Eraser</h2><p>Even if you use a nice pencil you probably want a serious eraser. This is really a matter of personal preference but I don&rsquo;t think kneadable erasers are powerful enough; you want something that will take the line off in one or two passes so you don&rsquo;t tear up the tracing paper. I like the brown cube ones or Staedtler Mars Plastic ones.</p><h2 id=tracing-paper-roll>Tracing paper roll</h2><p>You&rsquo;ll need a roll of tracing paper at least 12" wide but 18" or more is better, especially if you want to make full dresses or skirts or you have wider hips. It comes in white and yellow; I prefer the yellow paper because I think it makes tracing easier but this is a matter of personal preference. Don&rsquo;t get a roll that is wider than the table you have to work with or you&rsquo;ll be constantly frustrated.</p><h2 id=clear-tape-and-masking-tape>Clear tape and masking tape</h2><p>You will need to tape pieces together on occasion. Whether you need to use clear or masking tape will be one of those judgement calls: will you need to do more tracing or walking of the pattern? If so, probably clear. Is it the final revision and you&rsquo;ll be using the pattern for tracing to heavier paper or fabric? Masking tape is better.</p><h2 id=french-or-ship-curve>French or ship curve</h2><p>It&rsquo;s better to use a curve than to try to draw curves freehand. Accuracy matters especially when you start walking the patterns and tracing. Sometimes you can draw a curve with the styling rule after some practice but even one or two additional curves will come in handy. I prefer the ones made of colored acrylic - they&rsquo;re easier to sight the curve against the tracing paper than the clear ones, especially if you&rsquo;re also using white tracing paper.</p><h2 id=calculator>Calculator</h2><p>There is a lot of basic arithmetic and algebra in pattern making. A basic (non-scientific) calculator is helpful to check your assumptions.</p><h2 id=grid-paper-notebook>Grid paper notebook</h2><p>I use a spiral-bound school notebook with a dot grid; nothing little and fancy, because I draw out mini versions of the pattern before I break out the tracing paper, and usually I work through all the construction steps before I start tracing too. So I go through a lot of notebooks. I find that this degree of pre-thinking the pattern helps immensely with the finished piece. I like to dot grid more than a regular grid because it makes drawing the pattern mockups easier.</p><h2 id=t-pins-and-a-temporary-surface-for-your-table-to-stick-the-pins-into>T-pins and a temporary surface for your table to stick the pins into</h2><p>T-pins are long and strong straight pins with the non-pointy end bent into a T shaped terminus. I&rsquo;m not sure what they&rsquo;re used for in the real world - maybe pinning papers to a corkboard? - but there is a phase of pattern drafting called <code>pivoting</code> where multiple layers of tracing paper are pinned together at a specific point and different layers of paper are rotated around that pivot point in order to create a dart or new pattern piece.</p><p>A professional pattern table will have a top that accepts pins for this purpose, but amateurs are probably using the kitchen table or a drawing desk. Self-healing cutting mats don&rsquo;t really work because you can&rsquo;t sink a pin into them. I&rsquo;ve created a table cover that I use just for this purpose with a few layers of cardboard from old packages covered with canvas. I&rsquo;ve also used foamcore board covered with paper to good effect.</p></div></div><footer><hr><div class=footer-text><div>Â© Mona Maret.
