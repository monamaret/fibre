Hello! Welcome to my personal hobbyist site focused on fibre arts, sewing and patternmaking. I have been sewing since I was a teenager and make the majority of my own clothing. In another timeline I may have been a professional but in this one I am merely an advanced amateur with too many projects.

This site is where I document various processes related to my hobby, such as drafting and construction steps, types of stitches and finishing techniques. It is not a site dedicated to sharing the completed works; it is more like an open project notebook for documenting how I've done something and sharing with others.
