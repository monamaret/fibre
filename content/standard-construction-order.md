If you spend a lot of time sewing commercial home patterns, unless you have a very skilled person around to show you some clever tricks, you'll probably have a bad and frustrating time the first few sleeves you sew to a bodice. It turns out there is a much, much easier way to approach sleeves: the way factories do it. The trick is in the standard order of assembling the various pieces.

In most commercial home patterns, the instructions tell you to construct the bodice by sewing the front to the back at the shoulders and the sides, leaving the front or back seam open. You then construct the sleeve by closing the long seam inside the arm. Finally, you turn the sleeve inside out, the bodice inside out, and sew them together around the armscye curve. It's not just you: sewing around a closed curve is actually one of the most difficult seams to do, period. The reason commercial patterns write their instructions this way is so you can do fitting while the garment is partially made, but with the final fabric (because most home sewists don't make test garments to check the fit).

It's probably worthwhile to make test garments to check the fitting if you're willing to spend the money on fabric to make something for yourself, and if you're willing to do that, there is a much, much easier way to sew the sleeves in (and construct the entire garment): change the order you assemble the pieces and the garment. You'll lose the ability to do fitting midway through the construction process, but it will also make sewing the piece much much faster, and the process will work for pretty much all symmetrical open-ended garments (skirts, shirts and dresses).

Here is the standard construction order. I'll use the example of a simple dress with a separate bodice and skirt piece, bodice and skirt darts, and sleeves with cuffs. The front of the dress has no center seam, but the back does. The bodice front and back are fully faced, which finish the collar. For a little added flair, the shoulder and side seams are finished with french seams.

## 1. assemble the full front, minus sleeves or pockets

Sew the darts closed. Attach the skirt to the bodice.  

## 2. assemble the full back, minus sleeves or pockets

Close the darts. Sew the center back seam. Attach the skirt back to bodice back.

## 3. assemble the full front face

Sew the darts closed. Turn under the waistline edge and finish.

## 4. assemble the full back face

Sew the darts closed. Turn under the center back waistline edge and finish.

## 5. attach the front to front face at front collar

Top faces together, sew the front face to the front bodice at the neckline. Turn right side out and press flat.

## 6. attach the back to the back face at the collar

Top faces together, sew the back face to the back bodice at the neckline. Turn right side out and press.

## 7. assemble the full sleeve and cuffs (but not the long inner arm seam)

Assemble the cuffs, turn right side out, press flat, then turn under unsewn edges and press again. Sew to upper sleeve piece. Close any sleeve darts. Leave the inner arm seam unsewn for the moment, but do any ease basting or pre-gathering stitches.

## 8. attach front to back at shoulders (french seam)

Arrange the garment front and garment back so the top faces are out (right sides out). Sew the front to back at the shoulder, then turn the garment inside out and sew just outside the exterior shoulder seam (french seam), enclosing the exterior seam fully.

## 9. sew sleeve to shoulders at armscye

Arrange the garment so the front and back are top sides up and fully extended (right side out and open). Baste, pin or clip the center top of the sleeve to the closed seam of shoulder of the garment, right sides together. Ease any excess between the sleeve and the bodice and baste, pin or clip each side, then sew sleeve to bodice. (It's much easier when everything is still flat!) You can hide the sleeve-bodice join under the facing if you sew the sleeve to the outer bodice and then do a flat-felled seam using the facing, or turn and clip the raw edge of the facing and then sew it down by hand so that it doesn't pass through the outer bodice.

## 10. sew sleeves closed

Turn garment inside out, fold at should seam and close the sleeves to the bodice.

## 11. sew side seams (french seam)

Turn garment right side out, sew front to back at sides. Turn inside out, finish side seams (french seam), full enclosing the external seam.

## hems

If you're confident in where the hem should be placed (because you did a test fitting earlier), you should do the hems in steps 1 and 2. If you're not sure or you aren't confident in the cutting, you can do the hems last, because if the pattern isn't cut well or walked poorly (and most multi-sized commercial patterns fall in this category) the hems will probably be uneven at the side seams if you do them at the beginning.
